# 🎥 Discord Video Compressor

🚧 **Work in Progress** 🚧  
This project is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are greatly appreciated!

## Overview
The Discord Video Compressor is a user-friendly application designed to compress video files for easy sharing on Discord. Built using **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **FFmpeg**, the tool leverages the H.265 (HEVC) codec for high-efficiency compression. It automatically detects available GPU acceleration, falling back on CPU-based compression when necessary. Featuring drag-and-drop functionality, customizable settings, and real-time progress tracking, this tool makes video compression fast and simple.

### Key Features

- 📥 **Drag and drop** a video file directly into the app for compression.  
- 📊 **Progress tracking** through an intuitive progress bar.  
- ❌ **Cancel option** to stop the compression at any time.

## Roadmap
Planned features for future releases include:

- 🔄 **Automatic update check** to ensure you're always using the latest version.

## Getting Started

1. Launch the application.
2. Drag and drop a video file (supported formats: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.flv`) into the app window.
3. The compression process will start automatically, and the progress bar will update in real-time.
4. To cancel the process, click the ❌ **Cancel** button.
5. Once complete, the original video will be replaced by the compressed version.
